# Netpipes

> An operating system, a SIEM, and a Holy C IDE. It's a way of life, netpipes

<details>
<summary>Actual purpose</summary>

The purpose of netpipes is to simulate a 2D plane of items which can be networked together by being positioned directly adjacently in any direction (except diagonally).

Why? No clue. Random idea which helped me learn more C.

### Startup Banner and Network Balance Report

The program displays a startup banner, and then reports if there are any misbalances with any of the networks.

This report shows the item types at each position in the item plane.

### Adjacent Planes Report

This report shows item types alongside their network IDs at each position in the item plane. 

This view provides the convenience of the Item Types and Network IDs report being effectively merged.
